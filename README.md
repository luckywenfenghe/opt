MATLAB code for density-based topology optimisation of Navier-Stokes fluid flow with thermal. The code is based on journal publication: "A detailed introduction to density-based topology optimisation of fluid flow problems with implementation in MATLAB", Joe Alexandersen (2023), SMO 66:12, doi:10.1007/s00158-022-03420-9

The authors preprint is available here as "Alexandersen2022_preprint.pdf" and a detailed description of the files of the code base is given in "supplementary_codeDescription.pdf".you can serch it for deep understanding.
